# Examining the User Experience of Existing Human Trafficking Serious Games
Role: UX researcher  
Duration: 4 months  
Project Type: UX evaluation study

## Problem Statement
As part of the attempt to combat human trafficking, various developers have created serious games (games that prioritize education over entertainment) to raise awareness. However, their effectiveness and perception had not been sufficiently researched.

The goal of this project was to evaluate the user experience of these “human trafficking serious games”, with particular regards to perceived attractiveness, usability, motivation, and education utility.

## My Role
Under guidance of a supervisor and with the aid of my supervisor's colleague, I worked as a UX researcher. My responsibilities included defining conducting usability research, synthesizing insights, and proposing user-centered design solutions.

Due to academic restrictions, participant data and code used in analysis will not be shown. Rather, I will focus on describing the procedure, limitations, results, and implications.

## Research & Discovery
I conducted qualitative usability testing with 31 participants who were third-year university students taking a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course.

Research methods included:
- Having participants play five human trafficking serious games on tablets
- Having them complete a questionnaire after each one
- Using ANOVAs to analyze the data

The focus was on how players’ experiences with each game were, particularly how overall experiences were different between games, in order to find strengths and weaknesses within each game.

## Limitations
This study had some limitations, particularly regarding participants:
- Only 31 participants were recruited instead of the goal of 50
- Could not split 31 into equal groups (for order of games to play)
- Participants were primarily male and Asian

These issues meant that the sample size was not as large as hoped for, and that the results were not necessarily generalizable to other demographics.

## UX Insights
From the research, three core UX-related shortcomings were identified:
1.	The games were generally not perceived as providing user autonomy or being realistic (possibly due to characters’ limited agency, demonstrating the “ideal victim” trope in which victims are inaccurately portrayed as completely helpless and dependent on a savior)
2.	Some games lacked audio-visual appeal (they had simple 2D images) compared to the rest (which either had a 3D environment, detailed 2D images, or a unique art style)
3.	Participants did not find the games to be relevant to their interests

Together, these issues prevented the games from providing an excellent user experience.

## Design Goals
Based on the research findings, the following UX-related goals for human trafficking serious games were defined:
- Provide user autonomy and maintain a realistic setting
- Ensure the game has memorable visuals
- Make the game relevant to players’ interests

## Proposed UX Solutions
### Increased Agency for the Player (and Characters)
Allow more choices for the player, both in the game settings, and in the actions their character can perform (especially if said character is the victim to avoid the “ideal victim” trope). Avoid oversimplifying scenarios, and show that there are often actions that can be done to avoid becoming a victim or escape.

**Rationale:** Allows players to tailor the game to their preferences and retain a sense of control and independence, as well as hope which can make their experience less depressing.

### Memorable Visuals
Ensure the visuals are not perceived as generic, either by using 3D models or coming up with a unique and/or detailed art style for 2D images.

**Rationale:** These visuals will stand out in players’ memory, making the game and its message more likely to be remembered.

### Relevance to Players’ Interests
Make the issue of human trafficking more relevant to players’ lives, such as by pointing out that it can happen near them or even to them. Highlighting the structural causes may further increase relevance if players find them relatable.

**Rationale:** If the issue becomes more personal, players are less likely to cast it and the game aside. In addition, providing details about human trafficking can give players a sense of feeling that they gained important knowledge and their time playing the game was worth it.

## Validation Strategy
If this project were continued, proposed solutions would be validated through:
- Having participants play the new games and the old ones
- Having them fill out questionnaires for each game and then comparing responses
- Asking them which game they found the most memorable and why

## Reflection & Learnings
This project found and addressed UX-related weaknesses within existing human trafficking serious games. It gave me experience in evaluating serious games with participants in a controlled environment and using the results to make recommendations for serious games (particularly about human trafficking) that may be created in the future.

## Why This Project Matters
This study demonstrates my ability to conduct UX research, identify usability issues, and propose thoughtful user-centered solutions. In addition, it helps those who want to raise awareness about human trafficking through serious games fare better at getting their message across, which can potentially save the lives of many more victims around the world. My recommendations can also be adapted to situations other than human trafficking.
